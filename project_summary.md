MySports is an event creation platform specifically aimed to match users into teams for various sports. It helps Users find sport events based on their preferences, meet training partners and create their own events.
Users are matched based on search criteria, profile information and filters. After this they are able to communicate in an integrated event chatroom to discuss details. 
The project is still in production. Within nine weeks, a fully working, mobile-first but responsive MVP with the basic functionality has been created and deployed. The aim is to continue development on MySports; getting rid of the MVP restrictions and extending the functionality of the MVP while keeping it easy to use.
The technologies implemented in this project include Figma, Express, Node, Python, React, Redux, MongoDB, Nodemailer, Socket.io, PassportJS, Axios, MomentJs, Bootstrap, and SCSS.
MySports is the final group project which was created in order to complete the Berlin TechLabs Bootcamp. The team disciplines included UX/UI design, Web Development, and Data Science. All disciplines were put into practice to develop MySports.

Our project consists of following parts:

Data Science: Set up a dataset with events and users with the goal of creating a matching algorithm: matching users with the type of events that would be interesting for them.
Web development: Develop a mobile first web application with backend handling the matching/ filtering functionality, and frontend implementing the UI design proposal.
UX Design: Creating an optimal user experience through Information Architecture and UI.
