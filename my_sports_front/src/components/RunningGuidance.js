            <p className="text-center">2 star running - I enjoy running from time to time and to get the heart rate up at jogging speeds.</p>
            <p className="text-center">3 star running - I have been running for a while, I like to push the tempo and meet my time goals.</p>
            <p className="text-center">4 star running - I am a fast runner and I will work my hardest at middle and long distance efforts. I enjoy a race.</p>
            <p className="text-center">5 star running - I’m a speed machine. I have racing experience and perhaps I’m capable of a marathon. Looking for other like minded racers to push me.</p>
